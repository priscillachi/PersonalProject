# PersonalProject
I have just finished my Object-Oriented Programming subject at university, using Java for both front-end and back-end development, along with build automation tools such as Gradle.
<br><br>
At the moment, I have not packaged it into an app yet. It is currently running in the terminal using Gradle. 
<br><br>
You can most likely tell that this is the first app I built outside of university assignments. I've built smaller projects over the past year or so, but they have always been strictly back-end. So... maybe don't judge the GUI of this app. Or do. If I'm bad, I'm bad. If I'm good, I'm good. You can be both the jury and the judge. Hopefully I can pass whatever test you have mentally placed on me xx
<br><br>
Most of the features in the app are just about silly things such as science-fiction books, linguistics, etc.
